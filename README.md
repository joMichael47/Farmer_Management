# Farmer_management
This repo concerns a project I've developed with spring where I'm practicing a little role management with spring security and a presentation with thymeleaf

## Technos:
#### - Springboot
#### - Thymeleaf
#### - Spring security
#### - JPA

To run you need to check the config in the [application.properties](src/main/resources/application.properties )
